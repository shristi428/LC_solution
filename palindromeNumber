Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
code:-
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        int num=x;
        int temp=0;
        while(x>0){
            temp=temp*10+x%10;
            x=x/10;    
        }
        if(temp==num){
            return true;
        }
        
        return false;     
    }
}
